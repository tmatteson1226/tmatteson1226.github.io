		<h1>Description/Reflections of Project</h1>
			<p>Welcome to our Python Project! Our game is called "Geek Battle". The idea of the game is to answer 20 questions, TRUE or FALSE.</p>
			<p>I think that we did a really good job making this project, even though we did have a struggle or two. I really would've liked to have more time in order to integrate more questions into the final product. --Trevor Matteson</p>
